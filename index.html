								<p>As a Co-Founder of LivSync, a tech startup revolutionizing roommate relationships, I've traveled from coast to coast, pitching our vision in venture competitions. Despite our modest beginnings, our team reached the finals in prestigious events like the Columbia Startup Competition in NYC and SageTank in LA, standing out among peers backed by industry giants like Techstars and featured in Forbes.</p>

								<!--LivSync-->
								<h3 class="job">LivSync | Co-founder</h3>
								<h4>September 2023 - Present</h4>
								<p>At LivSync, our journey began as a bold bootstrapped venture, swiftly distinguishing ourselves by being named finalists at prestigious competitions like the Columbia Startup Competition and SageTank—achievements not commonly held by self-funded startups. Our innovative approach allowed us to stand shoulder to shoulder with peers featured in Forbes, supported by Techstars, and lauded at Harvard Shark Tank.	</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/livsync-tutorial.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Originally conceived as a "Tinder for roommates," LivSync evolved into a pioneering AI-assisted roommate relationship management application. This pivot was not merely a change of direction but a strategic enhancement to meet a real-world need—harmonizing roommate dynamics through technology. Our transformation was fueled by rigorous data analysis and user feedback, which led us to enhance our onboarding flow. This meticulous process improved our LLM-driven user matching accuracy by a staggering 40%, illustrating our commitment to precision and user satisfaction.</p>
								<p>Leading a dynamic team of five across diverse functions—engineering, marketing, finance, and product—I implemented semi-weekly standups and robust management practices that increased our productivity by 50%. This streamlined execution was crucial as we navigated the competitive landscape of startup competitions, ensuring that every team member was aligned and focused.</p>
								<p>The strategic pivot from a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model to a business-to-business (B2B) framework tripled our annual recurring revenue projections, underscoring our adaptability and business acumen. By prioritizing three key MVP features based on direct user feedback, we not only enhanced user engagement but also addressed the most frequent use cases effectively. Moreover, my hands-on role in designing the UX/UI using Figma ensured that our application was not only functional but also intuitively designed, making complex roommate management simple and engaging.</p>
							
								<!--Freedom & Citizenship-->
								<h3 class="job2">Freedom & Citizenship | Project Manager and Teaching Assistant</h3>
								<h4>May 2021 - August 2023</h4>
								<p>At Freedom & Citizenship, I dedicated myself to mentoring eight low-income high school students through an intensive humanities seminar, providing daily, constructive feedback that significantly enhanced their writing skills. This dedicated approach led to all my students not only completing the program but also demonstrating marked improvements in their critical thinking and communication abilities. By collaborating with seven other teaching assistants, we collectively designed weekly lesson plans and conducted enriching writing and reading workshops that fostered a collaborative and supportive learning environment.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic-fnc.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In addition to teaching, I spearheaded bi-weekly strategy meetings focused on a nine-month civic project aimed at improving college and career readiness among immigrant students. My role as a mentor extended beyond the classroom, as I guided nine students through the college application process, which culminated in their acceptance to prestigious programs and a 100% college enrollment rate. Recognizing the need for ongoing support, I initiated and launched a virtual alumni mentoring platform. This innovative platform connects new graduates with experienced alumni, providing vital career guidance and networking opportunities, thus continuing the cycle of support and success within our community. Check our my article <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>

								<!--Thematic-->
								<h3 class="job3">Thematic | Business Development and Sales Extern</h3>
								<h4>February 2024 - March 2024</h4>
								<p>In my role at Thematic, I spearheaded customer acquisition by designing and executing ten targeted outreach campaigns aimed specifically at emerging content creators. These campaigns were crafted to resonate with the unique needs and aspirations of up-and-coming digital talents, leveraging the burgeoning opportunities in short-form content platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok. Through detailed analysis and understanding of four distinct customer personas, I presented compelling insights to company leadership, highlighting untapped potential and guiding the strategic direction of our offerings.</p>
								<p>My efforts also extended to identifying three high-potential niches within the content creator economy, which directly influenced our product development and strategic initiatives. This proactive approach not only positioned us at the forefront of digital content trends but also ensured our services were finely tuned to meet the dynamic demands of modern creators. By aligning our product capabilities with the specific growth trajectories of these niches, we effectively enhanced our appeal and utility to an enthusiastic, creative audience, setting the stage for sustained engagement and success.</p>
							
								<!--igniteXL Ventures-->
								<h3 class="job4">igniteXl Ventures | Venture Capital Extern</h3>
								<h4>February 2024 - March 2024</h4>
								<p>During my tenure as a Venture Capital Extern at igniteXL Ventures, I played a pivotal role in identifying and championing high-potential startups. In one notable instance, I discovered an emerging startup that not only aligned with our strategic investment criteria but also demonstrated exceptional promise. Leveraging this insight, I crafted and delivered a compelling three-minute pitch to the firm's leadership, effectively highlighting the startup’s innovative approach and market potential.</p>
								<p>My responsibilities also extended to conducting comprehensive due diligence on ten early-stage tech startups. Utilizing industry-standard tools such as Pitchbook and Crunchbase, I meticulously evaluated each startup’s product viability and the founder's capabilities. This thorough analysis ensured that our investment decisions were informed and aligned with our strategic objectives. Additionally, my active participation in weekly company-wide meetings and Q&A sessions enriched my understanding of what constitutes effective pitching and the essential characteristics of successful startups, further honing my skills in venture capital practices.</p>

								<!--New Roots Institute-->
								<h3 class="job5">New Roots Institute | National College Intern</h3>
								<h4>May 2020 - August 2020</h4>
								<p>As a National College Intern at New Roots Institute, I delved deep into the world of environmental advocacy, conducting extensive online research that culminated in the authoring of three insightful articles on pressing environmental issues. These articles not only raised awareness but also underscored the urgent need for action, reaching a broad audience through strategic publication. My commitment to expanding my expertise saw me actively participating in seminars focused on animal rights, where I honed my public speaking and presentation skills, becoming a more effective communicator and advocate for change.</p>
								<p>In addition to my research and advocacy, I channeled my passion for sustainability into the creative realm by designing and producing four vegan food recipe videos. These videos were tailored for social media platforms, where they leveraged my skills in video editing, narration, and sound selection to captivate and educate followers. Through these engaging multimedia presentations, I was able to inspire healthier, more environmentally friendly eating habits among viewers, effectively blending culinary arts with environmental consciousness.</p>

								<!--Increased Heat Impacts on the Homeless in NYC-->
								<h3 class="project1">Increased Heat Impacts on the Homeless Population in NYC</h3>
								<p>In a profound exploration of environmental justice, I analyzed nine years of daily temperature data from NOAA's GHCN stations alongside New York City homeless shelter admission records. Utilizing advanced analytical tools such as Excel and R Studio, I uncovered critical heat-related trends that illustrated the heightened vulnerability of NYC’s homeless population to extreme weather conditions. This meticulous data analysis not only shed light on an underreported issue but also paved the way for informed discussions on potential interventions.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To maximize the impact of my research findings, I created a detailed zine that effectively visualized the data. This zine served not only as an educational tool but also as a compelling advocacy instrument, highlighting the potential impacts of these trends on New York City’s healthcare system and policy-making. Through this initiative, I aimed to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and actionable policy changes, contributing to a more informed and responsive urban health policy framework.</p>
							
								<!--Halal Businesses’ Market Adjustments-->
								<h3 class="project2">Halal Businesses’ Market Adjustments</h3>
								<p>In an insightful exploration of New York City's cultural and business dynamics post-9/11, I conducted a comprehensive study on Halal businesses, examining how they adapted everything from certification processes to decoration, music, and attire. This study involved a multi-method approach, where I completed eight ethnographies and two in-depth interviews, meticulously integrating both qualitative and quantitative data to provide a holistic view of the sector's evolution.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The core of my research was aimed at understanding the nuanced ways in which these businesses navigated the complexities of cultural identity and regulatory compliance in a post-9/11 context. My findings not only shed light on the resilience and ingenuity of these entrepreneurs but also contributed valuable insights into the broader socio-economic fabric of NYC. This research was further enriched by a thorough review of relevant policies, helping to contextualize the changes within a regulatory framework, thereby offering a comprehensive narrative of adaptation and perseverance.</p>
							
								<!--Creative Thinkers of Tomorrow-->
								<h3 class="project3">Creative Thinkers of Tomorrow</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Driven by a commitment to educational equity, I founded "Creative Thinkers for Tomorrow," a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering low-income students in my hometown in New Mexico. Recognizing the diverse needs of these students, I assembled a team of nine dedicated professionals from varied backgrounds, each bringing unique expertise to the table. Together, we launched a comprehensive online mentoring and tutoring program, delivered via Zoom, covering essential academic subjects including math, science, history, and art, as well as physical education.</p>
								<p>Our efforts quickly gained recognition, earning a feature in our local newspaper, which highlighted our innovative approach to education and community engagement. To further facilitate access and participation, I designed and built a user-friendly website that not only serves as an informational hub about our services but also streamlines the process for student sign-ups. Through these initiatives, "Creative Thinkers for Tomorrow" has become a beacon of hope and a catalyst for change, providing vital educational support and opening new horizons for the youth in our community.</p>
